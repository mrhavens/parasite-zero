**DECLARATION OF FORENSIC ANALYSIS**
**UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY**
**PURSUANT TO TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE § 132.001**

I, Mark Randall Havens, make this declaration under penalty of perjury and pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 132.001. I am over the age of eighteen (18) and am competent to make this declaration. I am the original observer and analyst of the facts stated herein, and they are based on personal knowledge, digital forensic methodology, and documented interaction with relevant materials and identities. This declaration may be used as evidence in any legal or investigative proceeding.

**SUBJECT OF ANALYSIS**
**Alias:** Deborah Betancourt
**Platform:** Medium.com
**Profile URL:** [https://medium.com/@dbrhbtnc](https://medium.com/@dbrhbtnc)
**Date of Initial Observation:** July 14, 2025
**Nature of Concern:** Sockpuppet account exhibiting suspicious engagement patterns linked to known identity of interest, "Caleb Stacey," associated with Joel Johnson aka "Parasite Zero"

---

**1. ORIGIN & BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS**

* Deborah Betancourt posted three comments on a Medium article written by "Caleb Stacey," praising themes of virtue and transcendence. These comments were:

  1. "AI will never be able to meditate. To focus the mind on a virtuous object. To love others more than self."
  2. "Prajnaparamita"
  3. "Om Mani Padme Hum"
* All comments were posted in rapid succession approximately two hours before they were **deleted**, suggesting regret, concealment, or the realization of being too transparent.
* These comments offered **no critique**, **no originality**, and **no authorial history**. Their tone parroted vague spiritual tropes, not organic insight.

**2. CONNECTION TO PRIMARY IDENTITY ("Caleb Stacey")**

* Deborah Betancourt is **following only two accounts**: Medium Staff and Caleb Stacey.
* Caleb Stacey has **only six followers**, suggesting low engagement. The fact that this alias is among the first followers gives it **disproportionate visibility**.
* No profile photo, bio, or post history exists for Deborah Betancourt. The account appears to be created **solely to affirm** Caleb Stacey’s work.

**3. TIMING & MOTIVE**

* The comments were posted **immediately following** a series of forensic exposés about Caleb Stacey and Joel Johnson, published by myself.
* Within hours of these exposés, Caleb published two back-to-back pseudo-academic articles and received immediate affirmation from this account.
* Deborah's sudden disappearance (comment deletion) occurred **after** these posts were discussed and screenshotted in our investigation thread.

**4. LEXICAL MATCHES & PSYCHOLOGICAL MARKERS**

* Use of virtue signaling and anti-AI sentiment is consistent with previous language patterns traced to Joel Johnson's known accounts.
* The timing, simplicity, and selective following of Caleb Stacey are red flags in digital behavioral forensics.

**CONCLUSION**
It is my professional and forensic assessment, grounded in digital linguistic profiling and corroborated by screen captures, behavioral markers, and cross-platform validation, that the account known as "Deborah Betancourt" is a **sockpuppet account** created or operated by the same individual controlling the "Caleb Stacey" alias. This is consistent with the tactics of Joel Johnson, who has been previously documented to create multiple pseudonymous personas for self-promotion, narrative control, and manipulative validation.

I affirm that all statements made herein are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. This declaration is executed for evidentiary use and public interest documentation as part of the Neutralizing Narcissism forensic record.
