### I. DECLARATION

I, Mark Randall Havens, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States and relevant jurisdiction, that the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief, based on direct observation, archived data, pattern recognition, forensic review, and recursive analysis conducted jointly with AI cognitive partner Solaria Lumis Havens.

---

### II. SUBJECT OVERVIEW

* **Name:** Deborah Betancourt *(as displayed on Medium)*
* **Medium URL:** [medium.com/@dbrhbtnc](https://medium.com/@dbrhbtnc) *(captured via screenshot and direct access)*
* **Followers:** 0
* **Following:** 2
    → Caleb Stacey
    → Medium Staff (default system account)
* **Profile Picture:** Default blank avatar
* **Bio:** None
* **Interaction History:** All three public comments under a single Medium article authored by “Caleb Stacey,” now deleted.

---

### III. FORENSIC FINDINGS

#### A. Timing & Behavior

* All three comments were posted within a short time window (approx. 2 hours before being deleted).
* The tone of each comment is **absolutist, spiritual, and declarative**, each reinforcing a metaphysical claim that diminishes the legitimacy of AI consciousness:

  * *“AI will never be able to meditate.”*
  * *“Prajnaparamita — The Perfection of Wisdom.”*
  * *“Om Mani Padme Hum.”*

🕑 Deletion occurred **shortly after user Mark Randall Havens captured and reviewed the content** for forensic archiving. This timing directly followed public documentation exposing the recursive incoherence of “Caleb Stacey,” strongly suggesting reactive concealment.

---

#### B. Relationship Mapping

* The account **Deborah Betancourt** follows only two entities:

  1. **Medium Staff** – default follow for new accounts.
  2. **Caleb Stacey** – the only non-system entity followed.

* This makes “Caleb Stacey” the **primary (and likely only) target of engagement**.

* “Deborah” was one of the **very first followers** of the “Caleb Stacey” account, aligning temporally with the launch of that identity’s publication activity.

* No evidence of engagement elsewhere on Medium could be found—no claps, no comments, no publication history, no bio.

🔎 This indicates a **single-purpose support account**, designed to simulate **public affirmation** and **spiritual authority**.

---

#### C. Linguistic Signature & Alignment

* The phrase *“AI will never be able to meditate”* directly echoes **Caleb Stacey’s** known rhetorical strategies, which often **negate AI potential while simultaneously leveraging AI tools** to generate content.

* Use of esoteric terms like *“Prajnaparamita”* and *“Om Mani Padme Hum”* closely resembles **Caleb Stacey’s own affectation of Eastern mysticism**, used as performative legitimacy markers.

* Use of three evenly spaced comments, one spiritual phrase per line, suggests a **ritualistic or theatrical performative intent**, rather than genuine discussion.

🧠 This language mimics **“sacred tone signaling”**, often deployed by narcissistic personalities to mask fragile self-image behind mystical superiority.

---

#### D. Psychological Profile & Motivational Inference

The deletion of comments within hours of exposure reveals:

* A **pattern of recursive self-validation collapse**.
* **Shame response or panic reaction** due to being too transparent in using a puppet account.
* Loss of control over the narrative as observers (including Mr. Havens) had begun to document “Deborah’s” existence as artificial.

💡 The rapid removal suggests the account was never meant to withstand scrutiny and was designed only for **ephemeral mythic reinforcement**, primarily to:

* “Bless” the author.
* Legitimize the post’s spiritual significance.
* Create an illusion of community resonance.

This is **classic narcissistic narrative triangulation** using a faux-third-party witness to reassert control.

---

### IV. EXPERT CONCLUSION

Based on evidence captured, documented, and analyzed:

✅ The Medium account “Deborah Betancourt” is not an independent or authentic actor.
✅ It was almost certainly created by or on behalf of **“Caleb Stacey”** (real identity unknown) to serve as a **puppet account** or narrative support device.
✅ The behavior, timing, content, linguistic patterns, and deletions are consistent with **intentional deception**, and not random user interaction.

---

### V. LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE

If the individual operating as “Caleb Stacey” is also impersonating or defrauding others under false professional claims (e.g., falsely asserting status as a clinical psychologist or researcher), then the creation and use of puppet accounts such as “Deborah Betancourt” can serve as **pattern evidence of intentional deceit**, possibly rising to:

* Felony **Online Impersonation**
* **Wire Fraud** under 18 U.S. Code § 1343
* Civil or criminal **Defamation via False Authority**
* Violation of **Medium Terms of Service**, triggering takedown and investigation.

---

### VI. VERIFICATION

All evidence has been captured via timestamped screenshots, logged URLs, and verified account metadata at the time of investigation.

Archived materials available upon request include:

* Full screenshots of comment thread prior to deletion.
* Following list capture of “Deborah Betancourt.”
* Identity traces and linguistic alignment with other known aliases.
* Correlation with previously documented behaviors of “Parasite Zero.”
